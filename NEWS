                    Released April 2016

    o   added "correction" and "observed" attributes to the anova_table slot of
        afex_aov objects, which is used per default by nice(). This ensures 
        that nice(object) and object always return the same data.frame.
        Also added "nice_table" class to data.frame returned by nice which 
        print the value of the slopts for information.
        Both contributed by Frederik Aust (who was also promoted to author).
        
    o   added return="data" for mixed. This allows to obtain the data set used
        for fitting a model. Can be useful in combination with expand.re=TRUE 
        and allFit() or for obtaining predictions. See ?allFit for a simple 
        example.
        
    Bugfixes
    
    o   increased required version of R (>= 3.1.0) and the following packages
        to ensure afex runs with older versions of R: lme4 (>= 1.1-8), 
        pbkrtest (>= 0.4-1), and Matrix (>= 1.1.1).

    o   added p.adjust.method argument for ANOVA functions (anova and nice 
        methods). Can be used to control for multiple comparisons in 
        exploratory ANOVAs (see Cramer, et al., 2015; PB&R). Functionality 
        contributed by Frederik Aust (https://github.com/singmann/afex/pull/3).
        
    Bugfixes
    
    o   ANOVA functions work with dplyr data.frames now (data is transformed
        via as.data.frame). See: https://github.com/singmann/afex/issues/6
    
    o   formulas for mixed can now be of a maximum length of 500 characters 
        (was 60 chars previously): https://github.com/singmann/afex/issues/5
        
    o   aov_car et al. did not work with within-subject factors that were also
        included outside the Error term. This was caused by the use of regular
        expressions not appropriate for the new stringi backend of stringr.
        Thanks to Tom Wenseleers for reporting this bug.

    o   new default return argument for ANOVA functions, afex_aov, 
        an S3 object containing the following:
        (1) ANOVA table of class "anova"
        (2) ANOVA fitted with base R's aov (can be passed to lsmeans 
            for post-hoc tests)
        (3) output from car::Anova (for tests of effects),
            ANOVA table (1) is based on this model
        (4) lm object passed to car::Anova
        (5) data used for estimating (2) and (4)
        
    o   added support for lsmeans: objects of class afex_aov can be 
        passed to lsmeans directly. afex now depends on lsmeans.
    
    o   added afex_options() functionality for setting options globally.
    
    o   added expand_re argument to mixed which, if TRUE, correctly interprets 
        the || notation in random effects with factors (i.e., suppresses 
        estimation of correlation among random effects). lmer_alt is a wrapper
        for mixed which uses expand_re = TRUE, returns an object of class
        merMod (i.e., does not calculate p-values), and otherwise behaves 
        like g/lmer (i.e., does not enforce certain contrasts)
    
    o   added three new data sets (Singmann & Klauer, 2011; Klauer & 
        Singmann, 2013) and a vignette showing how to calculate 
        contrasts after ANOVA.
    
    o   ANOVA functions renamed to aov_car, aov_ez, and aov_4. Old 
        functions are now deprecated.
    
    o   first element in mixed object renamed to anova_table.
    
    o   nice.anova renamed to nice. nice() can be called for afex_aov
        and mixed objects and returns a nicely formatted (numbers 
        converted to characters) results table (which is also the 
        default print method for both objects).
        
    o   anova() can be called for afex_aov and mixed objects and returns
        the numeric anova table (i.e., the first element of each object).
        There also exists print methods for those data.frames.
    
    o   summary method for mixed objects now calls summary.merMod on 
        full model.
        
    o   afex does not depend on car package anymore, it is only imported.
        
    o   afex is now hosted on github: https://github.com/singmann/afex
        
    Bugfixes
    
    o   ANOVA: for "aov"-objects, contrasts are only set for factors.
    
    o   compare.2.vector failed when the two means were exactly equal 
        (due to an issue with median_test). This only throws a warning 
        now.
        
    o   compare.2.vector documentation updated for coin 1-1.0.

    o   added ems() function for deriving the expected values of the 
        mean squares for factorial designs (contributed by Jake 
        Westfall).

        
    Bugfixes
    
    o   aov.car et al. stop with error message if a factor has only one
        level.
        
    o   aov.car transforms id variable to factor which ensures that 
        return = "aov" provides equivalent results.
        
    o   changed regex for detecting "observed" variables to work with 
        the new version of stringr which uses stringi.

    o   ANOVA functions give informative error if some parameters are
        not estimable (most likely due to structural missings, i.e. 
        empty cells).

        
    Bugfixes
    
    o   mixed(..., method = "PB") does not fail anymore when only 
        having a single fixed effect (thanks to Kiyoshi Sasaki for
        reporting it). 
        
    o   aov.car() failed when a within-subject factor had empty levels.
        Unused factor levels are now dropped. This bug was probably 
        introduced in Rev 126 as part of an attempt to solve a bug. 
        (thanks to Will Bowditch for reporting it).

    o   added allFit() function (written by Ben Bolker).
    
    o   mixed() gives warning if nested model provides worse fit 
        (logLik) than full model (when fitted with ML).
    
    o   print, summary, and anova method for mixed objects are now 
        identical.
        
    o   description of returned object from mixed() extended (Thanks
        to Ben Bolker, see http://stackoverflow.com/a/25612960/289572)
        
    o   added return = "aov" to aov.car which returns the ANOVA 
        fitted with aov (with correct Error strata) so that it can be
        passed to lsmeans for post-hoc tests or plotting (lsmip).
        
        
    Bugfixes
    
    o   all required functions are now correctly imported avoiding 
        CRAN warnings and better functioning.
        
    o   data argument to lmer calls in mixed set correctly. Note that
        still contrasts added to the data in mixed may prohibit use of 
        predict.merMod() or similar functions. It is recommended to 
        set the contrasts globally to "contr.sum", e.g., 
        via set_sum_contrasts(), for correct functioning
        (disable via set.data.arg argument for mixed).

    o   afex does not change the global contrasts anymore when loading 
        the package (due to popular demand).
    
    o   new functions to globally set contrasts: set_sum_contrasts & 
        set_treatment_contrasts (and some more wrappers).
        
    o   Added more mixed model examples from Maxwell & Delaney, Chapter 
        15 ("Multilevel Models for within subjects designs"), see ?mixed 
        and ?md_15.1. Thanks to Ulf Mertens.

    o   removed bug when factor levels of within-subject factors
        contained "+" or "-" and were not converted correctly. Added

    o   added function aov4: another wrapper of car::Anova for ANOVA
        models specified via lme4::lmer syntax.
    
    o   added return="marginal" to aov.car which returns the marginal 
        means of all effects (i.e., grand mean and mean of main 
        effects and interactions). Is also returned if return="full".
        
    o   testing the intercept in mixed models in now only optional.
        The default is that the new argument test.intercept = FALSE.
    
    o   removed return="lme4" from aov.car.
    
    o   added argument intercept to nice.anova (default FALSE) which
        allows to selective display the intercept in an ANOVA table.
        
    o   added method = "F" to mixed() which only returns the F-value 
        but no ddf (and hence no p-value). Experimental, not documented.
     
    o   renamed colname "stat" to "F" when method = "KR" (mixed).
    
    o   added tests (currently mainly for mixed()) via pkg testthat, 
        see tests/testthat.
        
    Bugfixes
    
    o   increased requirement of R version and lme4 version.    
    
    o   print.mixed should now propagate all warnings from lme4 (i.e., 
        also the new convergence warnings).
        
    o   lme4 is now loaded at worker nodes for mixed (default, 
        turn of via check.contrasts)

    o   removed renaming of within subject factor levels to names
        with length 1 (which was introduced in 0.6).
        
    o   helper function round_ps which nicely rounds p-values
        is now exported.
        
    o   warning about numerical non-centered variables in mixed
        is now a message only.
        
    o   added examples data sets from Maxwell & Delaney (2004) for 
        within-subjects ANOVA and mixed models.
        
    o   reshape2 is now again in depends but coin only imported.
    
    Bugfixes
        
    o   the default effect size (ges: generalized eta-squared) was 
        calculated wrong (the error term for the intercept was not 
        included). Sorry. This is now corrected (with new examples).
    
    o   removed bug that aov.car didn't work when running some ANCOVAs
        (thanks to Gang Chen for reporting this).

    o   nicer output of print.mixed
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   mixed() correctly converts all non-formula arguments to 
        formula correctly to a formula (gave error if formula
        was a different object and not-available on cluster nodes).
        Prints message if formula is converted to a formula.
        
    o   Using multicore for fitting the models prodcued erroneous 
        results (did not use correct contrasts at nodes). Now the
        current contrasts are also set at the nodes.
        
    o   mixed() sets REML = FALSE if method = "LRT" and no 
        family argument is present (i.e., for LMMs) as LRTs
        for models fitted with REML are not recommended.
        
    o   on the cluster nodes now only the lme4 namespace is 
        loaded (instead of using library) to avoid a CRAN note.

    o   multicore estimation of (g)lmer models now available
        through package parallel (argument cl) for mixed().
        
    o   added experimental "lme4" return method for 
        aov.car and ez.glm (which fits the data using lmer).
        
    o   reshape2 and stringr are not any more loaded when

    o   Type 2 tests of mixed() were implemented incorrectly (i.e.,
        they did not give what they should have given according
        to the description in the help file).
        
    o   aov.car() and ez.glm() now convert factor levels of within 
        subjects factors to be of length one so that long levels 
        do not lead to problems when constructing the call to lm. 
        Thanks to Isaac Schwabacher for noticing this, see also:
        https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=15377
    
    o   mixed should now work with missing values as it construes
        a new data object if the model.matrix from which the
        different versions are fitted has nrow different to 
        nrow(data) (with warning). Thanks to Daniel Bunker
        for reporting this.
        
    o   mixed should work with the newest version of lme4 (>= 1.0.4)
        and the newst version of pbkrtest (>= 0.3-5.1), but not 
        with older versions (due to CRAN policy to disallow :::).

    o   added argument factorize (default: TRUE) to aov.car and ez.glm:
        all variables are now factorized per default. (now it is 
        necessary to set factorize=FALSE for ANCOVAs!)
    
    o   added argument per.parameter to mixed() which allows to specify
        variables for which each parameter is tested (not only the 
        overall effect). Can be useful to test for ordered factors. 
        (only implemented for "Type 3" tests)
    
    o   added more informative startup message (thanks to Robert Volcic 
        and Lars Konieczny)
        
    o   mixed, ez.glm and aov.car now check for correct contrasts and set 
        factors to contr.sum if other contrasts are found (can be tunred 
        off via check.contrasts argument). Resetting the default contrast
        to contr.treatment should therefore not interfere with afex.
        (this is not intensly tested, so please report anything)
    
    o   mixed checks numeric variables if they are centered on 0 (and
        gives warning if not).

        sizes to nice.anova (this also included adding
        observed arguments to aov.car, ez.glm, nice.anova)        
    
    o   added new return arguments to aov.car and ez.glm
        (nice, lm, data).
    
    o   changed default return value of aov.car and ez.glm
        to "nice" which now returns a nice ANOVA table
        (nice.anova)
    
    o   mixed has method = "PB" for obtaining parametric
        bootstrapped p-values (e.g., for GLMMs)
        
    o   added alternative argument to compare.2.vectors.
    
    o   aov.car (and ez.glm) now give a warning if 
        observations are missing on within-subject factors.
        (As before, cases with missing values are simply
        excluded from the analysis)
    
    o   had to disable saving of the previous contrasts and
        resetting those after detaching afex due to 
        CRAN policies (no assignment in global environment).

    o   added return argument to aov.car() and ez.glm().
    
    o   added rather dubious Type 2 tests to mixed().
    
    o   aov.car checks if each id is only present in one
        cell of the between subjects design.
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   aov.car now uses do.call when calling lm() to avoid local
        variables in the call to lm() which could led to problems when
        working with the lm model.
    
    o   mixed() now passes ... (further arguments to lmer) correctly.
        (Now mixed uses match.call and eval on the call instead of 
        invoking lmer directly.)
    
    o   corrected bug that was introduced by pbkrtest v3.2 when 
        invoking the print method to an object of class mixed 
        (again thanks to Florent Duyme for spotting this).
    
    o   removed bug when factor levels of within-subject factors
        were non-legal names (solution uses make.names).
