                    Changes in afex Version 0.4-x
                    Released February 2013

    Significant User Visible Changes and New Features

    o   added generalized and partial eta-squared effect
        sizes to nice.anova (this also included adding
        observed arguments to aov.car, ez.glm, nice.anova)        
    
    o   added new return arguments to aov.car and ez.glm
        (nice, lm, data).
    
    o   changed default return value of aov.car and ez.glm
        to "nice" which now returns a nice ANOVA table
        (nice.anova)
    
    o   mixed has method = "PB" for obtaining parametric
        bootstrapped p-values (e.g., for GLMMs)
        
    o   added alternative argument to compare.2.vectors.
    
    o   aov.car (and ez.glm) now give a warning if 
        observations are missing on within-subject factors.
        (As before, cases with missing values are simply
        excluded from the analysis)
    
    o   had to disable saving of the previous contrasts and
        resetting those after detaching afex due to 
        CRAN policies (no assignment in global environment).
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   Bug when running mixed() inside a function and
        handing the data.frame over as an argument fixed
        (thanks, again, to Florent Duyme). See
        bugs/eval.scoping.bug.R
    
    o   nice.anova did not work with a model with only one 
        within-subjects factor.
    


                    ************************
                    ** afex VERSION 0.3-x **
                    ************************
                    
                    Changes in afex Version 0.3-x
                    Released August/September 2012

    Significant User Visible Changes and New Features
    
    o   added function compare.2.vectors().
    
    o   Name of function univariate() changed to univ(), as
        a function with this name is part of package multcomp.
        This may leed to problems. Thanks to Florent Duyme for
        spotting this.
    
    o   added return argument to aov.car() and ez.glm().
    
    o   added rather dubious Type 2 tests to mixed().
    
    o   aov.car checks if each id is only present in one
        cell of the between subjects design.
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   aov.car now uses do.call when calling lm() to avoid local
        variables in the call to lm() which could led to problems when
        working with the lm model.
    
    o   mixed() now passes ... (further arguments to lmer) correctly.
        (Now mixed uses match.call and eval on the call instead of 
        invoking lmer directly.)
    
    o   corrected bug that was introduced by pbkrtest v3.2 when 
        invoking the print method to an object of class mixed 
        (again thanks to Florent Duyme for spotting this).
    
    o   removed bug when factor levels of within-subject factors
        were non-legal names (solution uses make.names).
