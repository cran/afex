                    Changes in afex Version 0.3-x
                    Released August/September 2012

    Significant User Visible Changes and New Features
    o   added function compare.2.vectors().
    
    o   Name of function univariate() changed to univ(), as
        a function with this name is part of package multcomp.
        This may leed to problems. Thanks to Florent Duyme for
        spotting this.
    
    o   added return argument to aov.car() and ez.glm().
    
    o   added rather dubious Type 2 tests to mixed().
    
    o   aov.car checks if each id is only present in one
        cell of the between subjects design.
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   aov.car now uses do.call when calling lm() to avoid local
        variables in the call to lm() which could led to problems when
        working with the lm model.
    
    o   mixed() now passes ... (further arguments to lmer) correctly.
        (Now mixed uses match.call and eval on the call instead of 
        invoking lmer directly.)
    
    o   corrected bug that was introduced by pbkrtest v3.2 when 
        invoking the print method to an object of class mixed 
        (again thanks to Florent Duyme for spotting this).
    
    o   removed bug when factor levels of within-subject factors
        were non-legal names (solution uses make.names).
