                    Changes in afex Version 0.6-x
                    Released XXX 2013

    Significant User Visible Changes and New Features

    o   added LRT tests to mixed() which should replicate
        the recommended test by Barr et al. (2013, JML).
        
    o   multicore estimation of (g)lmer models now available
        through package parallel (argument cl) for mixed().
        
    o   added experimental "lme4" return method for 
        aov.car and ez.glm (which fits the data using lmer).
        
    o   reshape2 and stringr are not any more loaded when
        loading afex (are now only imported via Imports)
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   Type 2 tests of mixed() were implemented incorretly (i.e.,
        they did not give what they should have given according
        to the description in the help file).
        
    o   aov.car() and ez.glm() now convert factor levels of within 
        subjects factors to be of length one so that long levels 
        do not lead to problems when constructing the call to lm. 
        Thanks to Isaac Schwabacher for noticing this, see also:
        https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=15377
    
    o   mixed should now work with missing values as it construes
        a new data object if the model.matrix from which the
        different versions are fitted has nrow different to 
        nrow(data) (with warning). Thanks to Daniel Bunker
        for reporting this.
        
    o   mixed should work with the neweset version of lme4 (>= 1.0.4)
        and the newst version of pbkrtest (>= 0.3-5.1), but not 
        with older versions (due to CRAN policy to disallow :::).

                    ** afex VERSION 0.5-x **
                    ************************
                    
                    Changes in afex Version 0.5-x
                    Released May 2013

    Significant User Visible Changes and New Features

    o   added argument factorize (default: TRUE) to aov.car and ez.glm:
        all variables are now factorized per default. (now it is 
        necessary to set factorize=FALSE for ANCOVAs!)
    
    o   added argument per.parameter to mixed() which allows to specify
        variables for which each parameter is tested (not only the 
        overall effect). Can be useful to test for ordered factors. 
        (only implemented for "Type 3" tests)
    
    o   added more informative startup message (thanks to Robert Volcic 
        and Lars Konieczny)
        
    o   mixed, ez.glm and aov.car now check for correct contrasts and set 
        factors to contr.sum if other contrasts are found (can be tunred 
        off via check.contrasts argument). Resetting the default contrast
        to contr.treatment should therefore not interfere with afex.
        (this is not intensly tested, so please report anything)
    
    o   mixed checks numeric variables if they are centered on 0 (and
        gives warning if not).
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   checks if observed variable is in the data and throws
        an error if not (nice.anova)

                    Changes in afex Version 0.4-x
                    Released February 2013

    Significant User Visible Changes and New Features

    o   added generalized and partial eta-squared effect
        sizes to nice.anova (this also included adding
        observed arguments to aov.car, ez.glm, nice.anova)        
    
    o   added new return arguments to aov.car and ez.glm
        (nice, lm, data).
    
    o   changed default return value of aov.car and ez.glm
        to "nice" which now returns a nice ANOVA table
        (nice.anova)
    
    o   mixed has method = "PB" for obtaining parametric
        bootstrapped p-values (e.g., for GLMMs)
        
    o   added alternative argument to compare.2.vectors.
    
    o   aov.car (and ez.glm) now give a warning if 
        observations are missing on within-subject factors.
        (As before, cases with missing values are simply
        excluded from the analysis)
    
    o   had to disable saving of the previous contrasts and
        resetting those after detaching afex due to 
        CRAN policies (no assignment in global environment).
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   Bug when running mixed() inside a function and
        handing the data.frame over as an argument fixed
        (thanks, again, to Florent Duyme). See
        bugs/eval.scoping.bug.R
    
    o   nice.anova did not work with a model with only one 
        within-subjects factor.

                    Changes in afex Version 0.3-x
                    Released August/September 2012

    Significant User Visible Changes and New Features
    
    o   added function compare.2.vectors().
    
    o   Name of function univariate() changed to univ(), as
        a function with this name is part of package multcomp.
        This may leed to problems. Thanks to Florent Duyme for
        spotting this.
    
    o   added return argument to aov.car() and ez.glm().
    
    o   added rather dubious Type 2 tests to mixed().
    
    o   aov.car checks if each id is only present in one
        cell of the between subjects design.
    
    Bugfixes
    
    o   aov.car now uses do.call when calling lm() to avoid local
        variables in the call to lm() which could led to problems when
        working with the lm model.
    
    o   mixed() now passes ... (further arguments to lmer) correctly.
        (Now mixed uses match.call and eval on the call instead of 
        invoking lmer directly.)
    
    o   corrected bug that was introduced by pbkrtest v3.2 when 
        invoking the print method to an object of class mixed 
        (again thanks to Florent Duyme for spotting this).
    
    o   removed bug when factor levels of within-subject factors
        were non-legal names (solution uses make.names).
